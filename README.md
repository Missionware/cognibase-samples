## Chat Application

Learn how to create a minimal chat application.

1. Open Chat.sln solution in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Run or Debug the ChatServer
4. Run or Debug as many ChatConsoleApps as you want
5. To login use one of the preconfigured users that are in the app.config of the server (those accounts are there only for init, they are stored in db). You can use the same user in more than one console instances. Use the below:
- Domain FQDN (<YourMachineName>): Basic
- Domain (BASIC): Basic
- User Name (<Yourusername>) : user1 // or user2, ...
- Role Name ():   // click enter, just leave it empty
- Password (): user1 // or user2, ... 
- Save login (yes/no) ? (no): y
6. Then issue a join room command, eg "/join CognibaseFuns"
7. Now you are ready to exchange chat messages with other peers of your room
